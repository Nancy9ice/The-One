# The One
_The dataset of this project was analyzed exclusively with Microsoft Excel._

## **Problem Statement**
Roland owns an e-commerce company that sells vacations online via their website. Sales are going down and Roland isn't finding it funny. It's affecting his health too. He thinks something is wrong with the website and he has told the management to find someone that will show what is wrong. 

But there's another problem.

The website has several webpages where sales of different vacations are carried out. All these webpages can't be improved at once. It will cost so much money. So management wants to know that **one** webpage that needs to start being worked on first and they need it fast!

"Please do your best! The health of our CEO depends on the outcome of your analysis." Those words rang in my head as I collected the dataset containing the performance of their website from them.

## **All things but one, are on track**
Marketing is required to drive traffic to an e-commerce website but if the website isn't tailored to the needs of users, this traffic no matt how high will be a waste. 

The journey of a potential customer or user starts from this traffic. When this user gets on the website, the appealing visuals, high loading speed, and organized layout could make the user stay longer. If he doesn't leave because any of these is out of place, then the only thing that could make him leave the site is a complicated or non-intuitive navigation. Fortunately, this website has minimal bounce rate and even falls within the range of the e-commerce acceptable standard of 20% - 45%.
