# The One
_The dataset of this project was analyzed exclusively with Microsoft Excel._

## **Problem Statement**
Roland owns an e-commerce company that sells vacations online via their website. Sales are going down and Roland isn't finding it funny. It's affecting his health too. He thinks something is wrong with the website and he has told the management to find someone that will show what is wrong. 

But there's another problem.

The website has several webpages where sales of different vacations are carried out. All these webpages can't be improved at once. It will cost so much money. So management wants to know that **one** webpage that needs to start being worked on first and they need it fast!

"Please do your best! The health of our CEO depends on the outcome of your analysis." Those words rang in my head as I collected the dataset containing the performance of their website from them.
